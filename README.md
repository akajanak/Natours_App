I'd like to add the fact that this is not a complete project and only halfway done. 
Also the project itself is reference from udemy video and complete file can be found in https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-node-bootcamp.git 
Although this project is done progressively by following the video to gain insight on node, express, mongodb and mongoose implementation.
